                    The Health Maps project aims to provide data for geographies beyond county-level statistics to better serve cancer control,  public health, and policy efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Health Maps allows users to interactively map health data at a geographic level called zones, which are aggregates of census tracts. We have used a data-driven approach to define these zones, based on similar characteristics (poverty, urbanicity, racial/ethnic minority composition) and a minimum of 50,000 residents. These areas are generally smaller than county, but larger than census tract. Zones vary in population size from 51,229 to 98,764 with the number of census tracts ranging from 5 to 25.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Health Maps include 5-year cancer incidence rates based on the most current data for the most common invasive cancer sites by sex and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander). It also includes selected population sociodemographic data based on Census and American Community Survey data.

                    On this website, data are shown by cancer reporting zone.  These zones have been designed so that they have a minimum population, have similar demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and are geographically compact (they minimize the distance between different parts of the zone).  The minimum population for each zone is 50,000 people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Counties with larger populations (more than 100,000 people) were divided into multiple zones by combining adjacent census tracts.  For the rest of the state, adjacent counties and parts of counties were combined to form zones.  Three demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were used to determine similarity: the percent minority population (percent of the population who are not non-Hispanic White), percent of the population with incomes below poverty, and the proportion of the population living in urban and rural areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used population data from Census 2010 and Census 2010 tract geographies to construct the zones.  Poverty data came from the American Community Survey 2012-2016 5-year data.  We used a software zone design program called <a href="https://www.geodata.soton.ac.uk/software/AZTool/" target="_blank">AZTool</a> to identify aggregations of adjacent tracts and counties that optimize the three objectives: a target population of 50,000, geographic compactness, and similarity in terms of minority population, poverty, and urbanicity characteristics.

                        Census tract aggregation zones are developed based on combining adjacent census tracts on the basis of similarity in population sociodemographic characteristics: poverty, rurality, and racial/ethnic minority (i.e., non-White) composition. Zones are required to have a minimum population of 50,000. In total, there are 578 zones for California. Zones vary in population size from 51,229 to 98,764 with the number of census tracts ranging from 5 to 25. These areas are generally smaller than a county, but larger than census tract to help provide additional options for understanding disease burden and better facilitate public health and policy planning.

                        Counties in California can span up to hundreds of miles and include large and diverse populations. Surveillance of cancer burden at these large geographic scales may not be meaningful nor adequate for identifying areas with higher  disease rates. This information can be used by cancer centers, healthcare organizations, community organizations, and policy makers better serve cancer control, public health, and policy efforts.

                        The <a target="_blank" href="http://ccrcal.org">California Cancer Registry (CCR)</a> is California's statewide population-based cancer surveillance system. It collects information about almost all cancers diagnosed in California. The CCR is recognized as one of the leading cancer registries in the world, and has been the cornerstone of a substantial amount of research on cancer in the California population. To date the CCR has collected detailed information on over 7 million cases of cancer among Californians diagnosed from 1988 forward, and more than 175,000 new cases are added annually.                    
                        <br/><br/>
                        The California Cancer Registry is established in accordance with California Health and Safety (HSC) code, sections 103875-103885, requiring that cancer information be reported by law. HSC code section 100330 is also passed, requiring that all information collected remains confidential, patient identities kept anonymous, and patients informed, in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 2593. Under this authority, all health care providers and facilities providing diagnostic or treatment services to cancer patients in California are required to report information about such patients to the state cancer registry, via the regional registries. The Department has designated the three regional cancer registries in California, the <a target="_blank" href="https://crgc-cancer.org/">Cancer Registry of Greater California</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://csp.usc.edu/">Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance System</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://cancerregistry.ucsf.edu">Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry</a> as its agents for the purpose of collecting such data on behalf of this registry. The three California registries are part of the National Cancer Institute’s <a target="_blank" href="http://seer.cancer.gov">Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program</a>.

                        It takes several years for cancer incidence data for an entire population to be considered “complete,” that is, when a cancer registry is confident that all new cases of cancer have been reported. Selected population sociodemographic data and population estimates for calculating cancer incidence rates are from the 2010 Census short form, the most recent year of complete census data. Additional sociodemographic data are from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey; although more current American Community Survey data are available, these years were selected to more closely correspond to the other sociodemographic data and the population estimate data used for calculating cancer incidence rates.

                        Cancer is a group of diseases with many possible causes including genetic and clinical factors as well as social determinants of health. Common risk factors for cancer include smoking and tobacco use, diet and physical activity, sun and other types of radiation, viruses (e.g., HPV, Hepatitis B and C), chronic inflammation, and environmental exposures. Neighborhoods may influence cancer through multiple pathways including material deprivation, psychosocial mechanisms, health behaviors, and access to resources.

                        The neighborhood data are provided to characterize the zones based on several key social and built environment attributes. These are cross-sectional data on neighborhoods and cancer incidence so inferences regarding causes of cancer cannot be made. We have provided these data for the zones to help provide additional context for the observed cancer incidence rates. For example, a zone may have high colorectal cancer incidence rates; understanding the population-level characteristics of that zone can help community organizations and healthcare facilities target their screening and prevention programs toward the predominant populations within the zone.

                        Neighborhood measures were developed using data from census tracts. For socioeconomic status, we averaged the index scores across the census tracts within each zone and determined statewide quintiles at the zone-level. For Census/ACS other measures, we calculated a population weighted average of the values across census tracts for each zone. CHIS data estimates were developed using small area estimation methods described in these publications: <a target="_blank" href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302810">Generating Health Estimates by Zip Code: A Semiparametric Small Area Estimation Approach Using the California Health Interview Survey</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rssa.12351">A design‐based approach to small area estimation using a semiparametric generalized linear mixed model</a>.

This is important since the incidence of most cancers increases with age. An age-adjusted cancer incidence (or death) rate is defined as the number of new cancers (or deaths) per 100,000 population that would occur in a certain period of time if that population had a ‘standard’ age distribution. In the California Health Maps, incidence rates are age-adjusted using the <a href="https://www.census.gov/census2000/states/us.html" target="_blank">U.S. 2000 Standard Population</a>.

            Age-adjustment is a statistical method that allows comparisons of incidence rates to be made between populations with different age distributions. This is important since the incidence of most cancers increases with age. An age-adjusted cancer incidence (or death) rate is defined as the number of new cancers (or deaths) per 100,000 population that would occur in a certain period of time if that population had a ‘standard’ age distribution. In the California Health Maps, incidence rates are age-adjusted using the <a href="https://www.census.gov/census2000/states/us.html" target="_blank">U.S. 2000 Standard Population</a>.

              A statistical measure of the precision of the observed incidence rate. The lower confidence interval (LCI) and upper confidence interval (UCI) provide a range within which the true rate is thought to be with 95% confidence. Rates based on larger numbers are subject to less variation.
